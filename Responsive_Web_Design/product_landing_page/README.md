# Product Landing Page

In this project, I will implement from scratch, without any library, a symple product landing page, applying al the basic HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges learned on the FCC course: Responsive Web Design

The objective is simple: Have a fully functional and personalized landing page which compliance with the follwing User Stories.

### User Story 1:
My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".

### User Story 2:
I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.

### User Story 3:
Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".

### User Story 4:
I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.

### User Story 5:
When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.

### User Story 6:
I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".

### User Story 7:
My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".

### User Story 8:
Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.

### User Story 9:
The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.

### User Story 10:
The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.

### User Story 11:
Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".

### User Story 12:
When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit.

### User Story 13:
The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.

### User Story 14:
My product landing page should have at least one media query.

### User Story 15:
My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.
