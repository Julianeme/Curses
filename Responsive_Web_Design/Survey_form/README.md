# Symple Tribute Page

In this project, I will implement from scratch, without any library, a very simple tribute page, applying al the basic HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges learned on the FCC course: Responsive Web Design

The objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks like this.
